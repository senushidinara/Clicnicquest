🏥 ClinicQuest – A Gamified Healthcare Management Experience

ClinicQuest is an innovative gamified app built with Reddit Devvit that transforms healthcare management into an engaging, futuristic simulation. It allows users to roleplay across all layers of a hospital ecosystem — from doctors and nurses to patients, administrators, and even support staff — making healthcare learning, awareness, and collaboration interactive and fun.



✨ What It Does
	•	🎮 Roleplay Modes – Play as doctors, nurses, patients, admin staff, pharmacists, cleaners, and more.
	•	🧩 Mini-Games & Challenges – Diagnose patients, manage emergencies, allocate staff, or balance hospital budgets.
	•	🤖 Smart Avatars & Animations – Each role comes with a unique, customizable avatar powered by animations.
	•	📊 Dashboard View – Real-time simulation of hospital performance: patient flow, staff morale, and resources.
	•	🔗 Reddit Devvit Integration – Embed posts, leaderboards, and updates directly into Reddit communities.
	•	🏆 Community Competition – Reddit users can vote, comment, and influence outcomes of hospital-wide events.
